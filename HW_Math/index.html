<h3>Linear Equations</h3>
<p>   
A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
</p>
<p class="one">
    ax + b = 0 
</p>
<p>
    where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span>x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span>x</span> there.  
</p>
<h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
<p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
<p class="one">
    ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0
</p>
<p>
    where <span>a</span>, <span>b</span>, <span>c</span> are known values and <span>x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <span>a</span> can't be 0.
</p>
<h3>The area of a circle <span>A</span></h3>
<p>
    [sign]&pi; times the radius <span>r</span> squared:
</p>
<p class="one">
    A = [sign] [sign] r<sup>2</sup>  
</p>
<p>
    or, when you know the diameter <span>D</span>:
</p>
<p class="one">
    A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D<sup>2</sup> 
</p>
<p>
    or, when you know the circumference <span>C</span>:
</p>
<p class="one">
    A = C<sup>2</sup>  / 4 [sign] [sign] 
</p>
<h3>Intersection</h3>
<p>
    The intersection of two sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>, denoted by <span>A</span> [sign] <span>B</span>, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets <span>A</span> and <span>B</span>. In symbols,
</p>
<p class="one">
    A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }
</p>
<p>
    That is, <span>x</span> is an element of the intersection <span>A</span> [sign] <span>B</span> if and only if <span>x</span> is both an element of <span>A</span> and an element of <span>B</span>.
